# MSEdge-PDF-Viewer-Theme

A custom Tampermonkey script to enhance the viewing experience of local PDF files in Microsoft Edge. This script provides a selection of visually pleasing themes, such as Sepia and Light Gray, to improve readability and comfort.

## Features
- **Custom Themes**: Choose from a variety of themes, including Sepia, Light Gray, and more.
- **Interactive Theme Selector**: A floating gear button allows users to toggle a menu for selecting themes.
- **Simple Integration**: Works seamlessly with local PDF files opened in Microsoft Edge.

## Installation
1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) in your browser.
2. Create a new script in Tampermonkey and paste the content of `MSEdge-PDF-Viewer-Theme.user.js`.
3. Save and enable the script.
4. Open any local PDF file in Microsoft Edge to see the theme selector.


## How It Works
- When a local PDF file (`file://` URL) is detected, the script:
  - Adds a customizable overlay to apply the selected theme.
  - Displays a floating gear button to toggle the theme selector menu.
  - Allows users to switch themes interactively.

## Usage
1. Open any local PDF file in Microsoft Edge.
2. Click the floating gear button in the bottom-right corner.
3. Select your preferred theme from the menu.
4. The background of the PDF viewer will update instantly.
